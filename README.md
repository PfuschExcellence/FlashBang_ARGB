# FlashBang ARGB

## Aim
The aim of this project is to make a **simple extendible and highly performant** ARGB-Driver that is suitible for single-core microcontroller operation with other services running (for example [ESPAsyncWebserver](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer))

## Motivation

We are developing this library for all of you frustrated with the other libraries. All other LED-Driver Libraries for Ardunios seem to have  the common bugs, that they are not resistent to interrupts by other "processes" or caching problems.
